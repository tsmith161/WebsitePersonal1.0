I was born in Nyack, NY along the Hudson.

<p>This is my favorite place! The location is the Mahwah Museum. When I was a little 
    kid, my dad would bring me here if I behaved. My favorite part about the museum 
    was that it had a model train exhibit and the history of infrastructure in that town
    as well as an old Erie railroad caboose. To this day it is still my favorite due to 
    nostalgia, my continued love of trains, and seeing the history of an area nearby where
    I grew up!</p>
